FIDEL: Anywho, this is sorta just my usual stompin grounds.
FIDEL: I hang out here and have fun!
FIDEL: Mind the murals and, uh, wire sculptures. I like to consider myself an artistic soul.
FIDEL: ...and the broken glass. I was just tossing rocks once. I— I dunno. I was vibing. 
FIDEL: Hmmm… what else, what else? Oh!
FIDEL: It’s a ‘lil early for this, b-but I want you to meet my other friends!
PLAYER: Why are you blushing?
PLAYER: Your other friends are here?
FIDEL: Just stay right there, I’ll go get them!


[they run off, retrieve two rat mannequins. they resemble the player and mara a little.]
FIDEL: Here they are— my besties! 
PLAYER: Nice to meet you. | Huh.
> FIDEL: So polite!
   FIDEL: Thanks for being kind to them. Some people are so rude, y’know?
   PLAYER: ...Yeah.
> FIDEL: Hey, don’t be rude. I want my friends to get along!
   PLAYER: Are we friends?
   FIDEL: Okay, point. 
FIDEL: We’ve been through thick and thin together; we’ve been friends forever!
PLAYER: The— them? They look like you… found them yesterday. That’s… surprising.
FIDEL: That they don’t look older? Oh yeah, like I said earlier, weird time bubble.
FIDEL: Everything’s… frozen. I guess that’s the best way to explain it. 
FIDEL: You don’t have to think too hard about it.

-and that’s my theory on how all seagulls are just acoustic pelicans.
Oh, just in time. Here we are… our first stop!
You can open your eyes now.

//blur into view. standing in shitty mall clothing section
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_wry, 0.5, 0.5, #226677>>
Thanks for deciding to trust, heh, a stranger like me with taking you around town. 
For starters, this is my humble abode! Welcome.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #6764f7>>
…
This is— 
We’re in an old mall.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Sure are!
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
You live here.
In the clothing aisle?
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Well, you know what they say, one animal’s trash is another one’s beautiful home.
-> Do they, now?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_joke>>
	Do they, now?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	Yeah, and it’s *this* trash animal’s crib, heh! 
-> It’s nice.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_pleasant>>
	It’s nice.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	Aw, thanks. I don’t really decorate or anything.
	Intentionally, anyways.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_concern>>
Hmm.
Is that all it is to you? Just an old mall?
-> Should it be more?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	Should it be more?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	Ah… I guess not. It’s not important, don’t worry about it.
-> Doesn’t ring any bells, sorry.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_sorry>>
	Doesn’t ring any bells, sorry.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	That’s okay. I’m sorry, that must’ve sounded like a weird question. 
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
But that’s enough of that. Alrighty, camera crew, lemme hit you with the tour.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
I don’t have a camera.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
…It was a joke! C’mon, stick with it!
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
I don’t— okay. Let’s go.  
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_woah>>
Woah there, chief. Try not to get *too* excited. 
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
…
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
…
Shit, dude. Zero out of two. We’re gonna get tomatoed right off the stage.

//they walk a little bit and get into a more desolate part of the mall
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #226677>>
Anywho, this is sorta just my usual stompin grounds.
I hang out here and have fun!
Mind the murals and, uh, wire sculptures. I like to consider myself an artistic soul.
...and the broken glass. I was just tossing rocks once. I— I dunno. I was vibing. 
//he walks forward some more
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_thinking, 0.5, 0.5, #226677>>
Hmmm… what else, what else? Oh!
It’s a ‘lil early for this, b-but I want you to meet my other friends!
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #6764f7>>
Why are you blushing?
Your other friends are here?
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Just stay right there, I’ll go get them!
//they run off, retrieve two rat mannequins. they resemble the player and mara a little.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Here they are— my besties! 
-> Nice to meet you.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_pleasant>>
	Nice to meet you.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	So polite!
	Thanks for being kind to them. Some people are so rude, y’know?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	...Yeah.
-> Huh.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
	Huh.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	Hey, don’t be rude. I want my friends to get along!
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	Are we friends?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	Okay, point. 
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
We’ve been through thick and thin together; we’ve been friends forever!
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
The— them? They look like you… found them yesterday. That’s… surprising.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral>>
That they don’t look older? Oh yeah, like I said earlier, weird time bubble.
Everything’s… frozen. I guess that’s the best way to explain it. 
You don’t have to think too hard about it.

//there's a beat. and then they continue on their way
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #226677>>
Anyways, you hungry?
-> Yeah, I’m peckish.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #6764f7>>
	Yeah, I’m peckish.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
	Cool! Just don’t peck at me, yeah? Hah! 
-> Not really.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #6764f7>>
	Not really.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
	Me neither, but that’s where this path of debris leads, so we gotta blast!
To the food court! 
//fidel runs ahead and the player follows. they fuck around at a food court
Okay, okay. Don’t mind if I do! 
//they get to a counter and dive behind it
Welcome to Grilli’s, how can I help you?
-> Are you going to take my order?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	Are you going to take my order?
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
	Heh, absolutely not. I can’t help you at all! Who do you think I am?
	But I do have a very *un*helpful thing for you.
-> Cheeseburger.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
	Cheeseburger.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
	That’s not even on the menu. Get outta here, you heathen! Scram!
...Now come back. I have something real special to ask you.    
[PLAYER], do you...
Do you wanna see me eat seventy chicken nuggets?
-> No.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_mad>>
	No.
-> Absolutely not.
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_mad>>
	Absolutely not.
//automatically dismisses this in 0.2 seconds so it looks like they don’t get a choice
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Well, we can’t always have what we want, buddy.
Oh no, I dropped one. Ah beans, there it goes... down the drain. 
Now I have exactly one fewer than seventy.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
What drain? We’re in a food court.
I just watched you very deliberately open a carton and drop a nugget to the floor.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Haha, yeah. It’s gone forever. Goodbye.
So good of this fast food place to offer their nuggets in increments of seven like this.
Also they’re, like, technically ten years old, so I don’t actually want any of ‘em.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
They look fine to me. Is this the same deal as before? Another time bubble… thing? 
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
You’re learning! Yeah, it’s another one of those frozen magic deals.
Physically they’ve remained just a few hours old. The world hasn’t moved at all.
So they’re safe to eat! But it still feels icky. It’s, like, the principle of the matter. 
Mnm.
//fidel eats one anyways
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
… 
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Yeah, my body doesn’t remember what food is, so it’s disagreeing with everything.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
Why are you like this? 
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
You know me!
Or I guess you don’t.

<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #226677>>
So… you really don’t remember anything, huh?
I hoped coming here would jog your memory. But it was just that. 
Wishful thinking.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral, 0.5, 0.5, #6764f7>>
I'm. Really sorry.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral>>
Don't be.
This. This has been fun. I’m glad you’re back. I am. 
I know it doesn’t mean anything to you, but it was good to see you again. 
It’s just been so long. I didn’t think it was possible, I didn’t think things would ever be different.
-> … 
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	…
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral>>
	I just can’t do this.
-> Fidel… 
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ ?, player_concern>>
	Fidel…
	<<HideAll @>>
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_sad>>
	I just can’t do this, [PLAYER].
We’ve been living like this for so long. I thought it was okay, for things to just be this way.
For me to be alone out here.
For the world to be in a standstill.
And for me to just. Get by.
<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ ?, player_neutral>>
Hey.
I’m going to try something, okay?

This node is called Start_MoreExamples.
The second way to do choices in Yarn is with 'shortcut options' like this:

->This is option 1
	You selected option 1.
->This is option 2
	You selected option 2.
	<<set $didOption2 to true>>

Based on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables later.
<<if $didOption2 is true>>
By checking $didOption2, I remember you chose option 2!
<<else>>
I can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means you chose option 1
<<endif>>

Do you want to go back to Start now?
-> Yes, send me back to Start.
	[[Start]]
-> No thanks, I want to stop.

Ok here's the end, good luck!

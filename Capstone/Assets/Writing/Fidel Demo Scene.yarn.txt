<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_wry>>
Fidel: Thanks for deciding to trust, heh, a stranger like me with taking you around town. 
Fidel: For starters, this is my humble abode! Welcome.
//<<HideAll @>>
<<Act @ Piper, player_neutral>>
Piper: …
Piper: This is— 
Piper: We’re in an old mall.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Fidel: Sure are!
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
Piper: You live here.
Piper: In the clothing department?
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Fidel: Well, you know what they say, one animal’s trash is another one’s beautiful home.
-> Do they, now?
	<<Act @ Piper, player_joke>>
	Piper Do they, now?
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	Fidel: Yeah, and it’s *this* trash animal’s crib, heh! 
-> It’s nice.
	<<Act @ Piper, player_pleasant>>
	Piper: It’s nice.
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
	Fidel: Aw, thanks. I don’t really decorate or anything.
	Fidel: Intentionally, anyways.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
Fidel: Hmm.
Fidel: Is that all it is to you? Just an old mall?
-> Should it be more?
	<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
	Piper: Should it be more?
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	Fidel: Ah… I guess not. It’s not important, don’t worry about it.
-> Doesn’t ring any bells, sorry.
	<<Act @ Piper, player_sorry>>
	Piper: Doesn’t ring any bells, sorry.
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	Fidel: That’s okay. I’m sorry, that must’ve sounded like a weird question. 
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Fidel: But that’s enough of that. Alrighty, camera crew, lemme hit you with the tour.
<<Act @ Piper, player_neutral>>
Piper: I don’t have a camera.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Fidel: …It was a joke! C’mon, stick with it!
<<Act @ Piper, player_neutral>>
Piper: I don’t— okay. Let’s go.

//they walk a little bit and get into a more desolate part of the mall
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral>>
Fidel: Anywho, this is sorta just my usual stompin grounds.
Fidel: I hang out here and have fun!
Fidel: Mind the murals and, uh, wire sculptures. I like to consider myself an artistic soul.
Fidel: ...and the broken glass. I was just tossing rocks once. I— I dunno. I was vibing.

Fidel: It’s a ‘lil early for this, b-but I want you to meet my other friends!

Piper: Your other friends are here?
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Fidel: Just stay right there, I’ll go get them!
//they run off, retrieve two rat mannequins. they resemble the player and mara a little.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>

-> Nice to meet you.
	<<Act @ Piper, player_pleasant>>
	Piper: Nice to meet you.
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>

	<<Act @ Piper, player_neutral>>
	Piper: Huh.
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>

	<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
	Piper: Are we friends?
	<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_disappointed>>
	Fidel: Okay, point. 
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_happy>>
Fidel: We’ve been through thick and thin together; we’ve been friends forever!
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
Piper: The— them? They look like you… found them yesterday. That’s… surprising.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_neutral>>
Fidel: That they don’t look older? Oh yeah, like I said earlier, weird time bubble.
Fidel: Everything’s… frozen. I guess that’s the best way to explain it. 
Fidel: You don’t have to think too hard about it.

Fidel: Oh no, I dropped one. Ah beans, there it goes... down the drain. 
Fidel: Now I have exactly one fewer than seventy.
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
Piper: What drain? We’re in a food court.
Piper: I just watched you very deliberately open a carton and drop a nugget to the floor.
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Fidel: Haha, yeah. It’s gone forever. Goodbye.
Fidel: So good of this fast food place to offer their nuggets in increments of seven like this.
Fidel: Also they’re, like, technically ten years old, so I don’t actually want any of ‘em.
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
Piper: They look fine to me. Is this the same deal as before? Another time bubble… thing? 
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Fidel: You’re learning! Yeah, it’s another one of those frozen magic deals.
Fidel: Physically they’ve remained just a few hours old. The world hasn’t moved at all.
Fidel: So they’re safe to eat! But it still feels icky. It’s, like, the principle of the matter. 
Fidel: Mnm.
//fidel eats one anyways
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>
Piper: … 
<<Act @ Fidel, fidel_hah>>
Fidel: Yeah, my body doesn’t remember what food is, so it’s disagreeing with everything.
<<Act @ Piper, player_concern>>

This node is called Start_MoreExamples.
The second way to do choices in Yarn is with 'shortcut options' like this:

->This is option 1
	You selected option 1.
->This is option 2
	You selected option 2.
	<<set $didOption2 to true>>

Based on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables later.
<<if $didOption2 is true>>
By checking $didOption2, I remember you chose option 2!
<<else>>
I can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means you chose option 1
<<endif>>

Do you want to go back to Start now?
-> Yes, send me back to Start.
	[[Start]]
-> No thanks, I want to stop.

Ok here's the end, good luck!
